# Week 6 and 7 Lab
Group members: Jennifer Zheng and Naimah Aldridge  
This program takes a letter grade and determines what the GPA is. If a string is not entered, "Invalid input" is printed. If a letter that is not A, B, C, D, or F is entered, "That's not an appropriate letter." is printed.  
  
For example,  
What is your letter grade? Enter in caps. A  
Your GPA is a 4.00  

What is your letter grade? Enter in caps. 1  
Invalid input

We went with Unlicense because this is simple python code so anyone can use it if they want to. We went with Contributor Covenant because it had a detailed outline of what is expected and the consequences if it is not followed.
